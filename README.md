Hi, I'm Jacob ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer, obsessed with building tools and infrastructure that enable front-end teams to be productive. Currently, I'm building radical e-commerce user experiences at [Stylitics](http://stylitics.com).

Here's a list of some stuff I've built or contributed to that I'm proud of.

- [svelte-right-click - a custom context menu for your Svelte app](https://github.com/stordahl/svelte-right-click)
- [datahog - collect historical lighthouse data for you products](https://github.com/stordahl/datahog)
- [sveltekit-snippets - VSCode snippets for SvelteKit and Svelte](https://github.com/stordahl/sveltekit-snippets)
- [keg - a tiny cli for managing Homebrew](https://github.com/stordahl/keg)
- [jog - a shell script for those that can't remember npm scripts](https://github.com/stordahl/jog)
- [svelte-code-input - a simple text input that behaves like a code editor](https://github.com/stordahl/svelte-code-input)


~I'm currently available for hire.~
